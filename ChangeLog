prerelease 

    I changed the code to be more and more Model, View, Controller Pattern.
    The model is updated from the server using json http, using a view as a thread pool.
    Callbacks on changes to the model to the Controller can then trigger further things.

    In this case another View is triggered to display the model as the StatusBar and Tooltip, 
    which shows details about the current track playing, and server status.
